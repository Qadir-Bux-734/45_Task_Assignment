// Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.

// • Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

// • Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print
// a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.

// • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.

// • Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end
// of your program.

console.log(`Unfortunatily , I can invite only two Friends/Guests `);
let guests:string[]=["Imran","Qadir","Shahid","Akram", "Wajid","Mir","Sadiq"]
// Remove To Guests
  while (guests.length >2) {
    let removedGuests=guests.pop()
    console.log(`Sorry! ${removedGuests} I can't invite you to dinner.`);
        }
        //  two guest Still Invited to dinner 
        for (let friend of guests ){
            console.log(`Dear ${friend} You are Still invited to dinner.`);
            
        }
        //Remove All Guests And Show Empty List.
guests.splice(0,guests.length)
